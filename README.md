## Abstract

<li>Messes in VIT, owing to the large population of students are a bit harder to manage manually. Due to COVID-19, there is a lot of importance of having social distancing and hygiene and hence to address this issue, a need for such a management system arises. </li>

<li>The goal for making this project is to develop a mess management system for VIT in ASM, while keeping in mind the current pandemic situation which has made the systematic management of students even more difficult.</li>

<li>An 8086 Assembly language based system which can store information of VIT students and the staff will be able to view and create time slots according to criteria, and sort the students based on the hostel room numbers. </li>

## Abstract

<li>Messes in VIT, owing to the large population of students, it is too time consuming and tedious to manage everything. In most messes, the entire management is done manually on paper. Due to COVID-19, this task has only become tougher as not all students can be allowed to eat in the mess at the same time. To remain safe during these times, there is a lot of importance to maintain social distance and hygiene and hence to address this issue, the need for a proper management system arises. This would allow the same operations to be performed within a short period of time and without expending much effort or manpower.</li>

<li>The goal for making this project is to develop a mess management system for VIT in assembly language, while keeping the current pandemic situation in mind, which has made the systematic management of students even more difficult. For this project, we are implementing an 8086 Assembly language-based system which can store information of VIT students and the staff will be able to view and create time slots according to criteria, and sort the students based on different sorting parameters including college year, room number etc. </li>

<li>The system would not only enable the management staff to manage students more efficiently and effortlessly, but would also allow students to book mess slots for eating food at their own convenience. Hence, it would greatly benefit the catering staff, students and the VIT administration and enforce better hygiene and safety complying with COVID standards during mess hours.</li>
